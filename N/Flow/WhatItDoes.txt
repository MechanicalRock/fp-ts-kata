Syntax : 
    flow(f1,f2,f3)(arg)
What it does?
    - Same as Pipe but the first argument should be a function
    - First function can have one or more input
When to use?
    - when we don't want to avoid using an anonymous function

    Example 
    given: 
        Func(arg ,(arg)=>string)=> [arg,string]
    then:
        Func(arg, (arg)=>pipe(arg,f1,f2,f3)) 
    to avoid this we can use:
        Func(arg,flow(f1,f2,f3));
