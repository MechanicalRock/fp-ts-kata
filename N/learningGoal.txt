info:
    - Type class: The programmer defines a type class by specifying a set of functions or constant names, 
                together with their respective types,
                that must exist for every type that belongs to the class
                In fp-ts type classes are encoded as TypeScript interfaces

FP-TS:
constructor, meaning it can create the data structure.

semigroup: is a pair of `(A, function that takes two elements of A as input and returns an element of A as output)`.
            captures the concept of "merging" values (via concat).
            examples : (number, *) , (number, +) , (number, &&)
Functor : something that takes one type and returns another e.g. a => b like map
            
Bifunctor : is when you are dealing with stuff that might need to map either both sides of a type, or the “other” side -
            examples: Either<T,U> => bifunctors are mapLeft and bimap 
            (because these map over the left side as well as the right)

Monad:  stuff is usually constructors - all the “classes” like TaskEither, Either etc, are monads.
Utils:  are just random collections of functions that don’t make sense to put elsewhere


chain{IOEither]K and chain[TaskEither]K - the types are the hint. the ’K” mean it returns a function that returns the inner type.
IOEither - synchronous computation that might throw an error (assertion)
TaskEither - asynchronous computation that might throw an error (making a remote call that returns a promise)
TryCatchK - convert a function that returns a promise<A> to TaskEither<E,A>
Map - convert something inside something to another type (E,g, not performing another computation - just ‘mapping’ something to something else
