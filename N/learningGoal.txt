Methods to learn: 

- Pipe
- Flow
- Fold is destructors for either and taskEither
- Either
- Task
- TaskEither
- Chain
- Either : Combinators and constructors i.e ChainFirst
- TaskEither : Combinators and constructors i.e chainEitherK,chainIOEitherK, fromEither, fromEitherK,...
- Map
- tryCatch constructor for either, taskEither
- tryCatchK combinator for taskEither
- IOEither
- Bind util for almost all of methods
- BindTo util for almost all of methods


- I am aiming to explain my understanding with some examples for each method

- Each method in fp has constructor, combinators , destructors, utils I need to look at those for each method
