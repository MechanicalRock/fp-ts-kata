Syntax:
    fold<E, A, B>(onLeft: (e: E) => B, onRight: (a: A) => B): (ma: Either<E, A>) => B
What it does:
    - Takes two functions and an Either value, if the value is a Left the inner value is applied to the first function,
    if the value is a Right the inner value is applied to the second function.

Fold is actually a destructors. depends on Either<E,A> it would run the onLeft or onRight function.
